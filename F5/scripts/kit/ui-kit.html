                            <p>Developing software without a design first approach will cause user experience issues , inconsistency and can cause an additional 50% more developing work because not following design guidelines the application will never be finished design wise. Ex: Positioning an element multiple times during development playing with width , height and margins trying to obtain a visually pleasant aspect without respecting a standardized process.</p>
                            <p>Creating consistent UI , offering customers the best possible UX ( User Experience ). This manual will provide mainly general base guidelines that will create consistency around F5 IT`s developed software within our products or our clients products.App designs (prototypes and design files) is the main way to portray how the UI could like like and it`s the easiest way to communicate a proposal to the clients and developers, but in the end only what the developers can reproduce in code will make it to productions. There are severals concerns regarding the fact that even though tehnology allows the developers to fully implement almost everything from a design file in most cases it doesn`t. </p>
                            <p>And this is caused by reasons like : - <a href="#" class="primary-link">deadlines</a> , the design might not be practical to build , developer prioritising functionality rather than design work.</p>
