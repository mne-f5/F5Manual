                        Given that F5 IT`s develops complex apps with data and forms , creating practical forms to ease users form completion quickly
                        and without confusion is a must.

                    Forms are still one of the most important type of interaction inside an app considered to be the final step towards completing the goal that the user is after.

                <h2 class="small-m">Getting Started</h2>

                <h3>Form Components</h3>
                <p>Typical forms are composed of five elements </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Structure:</b> It is defined by the ordering of the fields , page arrangement and connection between fields.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Input Field:</b> Composed of text fields , password fields , radio buttons , sliders etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Label:</b> Tied to a input field it tells the user what information the field needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Submit button:</b> Action performing (submit data from fields.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Feedback &amp; Validation:</b> Indicates to the user if the result is positive or negative (Success form completion / Incorrect data input). Validation checks in real time if data completion is valid.
                </p>


                <h2 class="small-m">Form Structure</h2>
                <p>Form are like conversations representing the communication between the user and the app.</p>

                <h3>Logical Ordering</h3>
                <p>Forms should be arranged in a logical manner - Don`t ask for a phone number before asking the name</p>

                <h3>Avoid unnecesary data</h3>
                <p>Avoid asking for extra information as it could stress the user if the forms are to long</p>

                <h3>Group related forms</h3>
                <p>
                    Group fields that are related can be joined together making it easy for the user to scan the form.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/manual-content/group-form.jpeg">
                </div>


                <h3>One column always</h3>
                <p>
                    Forms shouldn`t consist of more than one column as using multiple columns can create inconsistencies. Users would be required to scan in a Z pattern
                    slowing speed of understanding. Yet single columns forms follow a single down the page path.

                </div>

                <h3>Number of fields</h3>
                <p>
                    Always minimize the number of fields as much as possible. Try to combine multiple fields.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/manual-content/combine-fields.png">

                </div>

                <h3>Label alignment</h3>
                <p>
                    According to Matteo Penzo`s article on label placement claims that forms are completed faster if the label is on top of the fields.
                    However other researches found no difference between left labels or top labels.
                </p>

                <h3 class="small-mt">Top labels</h3>
                <p>
                    The main advantage is that they can easily fit the graphic interface (specially for mobile screens).
                </p>

                </div>

                <h3>Left aligned labels</h3>
                <p>
                    Requires more horizontal space , provides a slower completion rate but it could be helpful because slowing completion could prevent
                    user errors.

                <h2>Conclusion &amp; Usage</h2>
                <div class="box negative">
                    <p>
                        The top aligned labels should be used on small forms - up to 6 inputs (login form , sign-up form etc.)
                        Left aligned labels should be used on bigger forms - Because it can help avoid errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Small improvements in forms cand lead to better user satisfaction when it comes to forms. Users are usually hesitant to form filling and this can be easily
                        changed when testing and improving the forms.
