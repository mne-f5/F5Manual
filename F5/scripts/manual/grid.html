                    <p>
                        This grid guide is meant to help designers and developers to have a common language with the purpose of laying out UI designs quick and consisten.
                        It is very helpful for mobile designs.

                <h3>Theory</h3>
                <p>
                    App designs (prototypes and design files) is the main way to portray how the UI could like like and it`s the easiest way to communicate a proposal to the clients and developers,
                    but in the end only what the developers can reproduce in code will make it to productions.

                    There are severals concerns regarding the fact that even though tehnology allows the developers to fully implement almost everything from a design file in most cases it doesn`t.
                    And this is caused by reasons like : - deadlines , the design might not be practical to build , developer prioritising functionality rather than design work.

                        <p>Box model consists of 4 elements : margin , border , padding and element size. </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Border:</b> the thickness of the stroke around the edges of an element. Most design tools do not allow this to affect overall spacing and dimensions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Padding:</b> the space between the bounds of an element and its child elements
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Margin:</b> the space between the bounds of an element and neighboring objects

                <h3>Principles</h3>
                <p>
                    The 8pt grid consists of placing elements while maintaining a 8pt increment in sizing and othe box model elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point (pt) is a measurement unit for space that depends on screen resolutions.
                    For example at @1X resolution 1pt = 1px.
                </p>
                <p> @2px 1pt = 4px (because 2x means double resolution)</p>


                <p>Multiples of 8 are used to establish sizing around an app. Sizing like margin , padding , borders and element size.</p>

                <h3>
                    Typography
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Most of the time text size and line-height will not conform to the UI grid .
                    To align text to the UI grid combine the 8pt grid with a 4pt grid .
                    Set the text to a consistent size then use padding to create the block element in such a way that is divisible by 8.


                </p>


                <h3>Method</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to apply the 8 pt grid.
                    The Hard Grid method (incrementing everything in a 8point) and a Soft Grid method that measures 8point increment between individual elements.

                    Most of the times the soft grid is used because it`s faster to implement and you can reach a high quality without spending additional time on it.

                <h2>Why use the 8pt Grid</h2>
                <p>
                    Using an even number will ensure scaling for a wide variety of devices.
                    The majority of screen sizes are divisible by 8.
                </p>

                <h3>Value</h3>
                <p>
                    When scaling follow a certain rule the result is a more consistent UI.
                </p><p><b>For designers:</b> Efficient , less time spend on decisions on how to mantain consistency between elements</p>
                <p>
                    <b>For developers:</b> This eases communication between designer and developer , eliminating friction related to the "pixel perfect". Developers can easily identify 8 pixels increments instead of
                    constant need for measurements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>For end client:</b> Consistent UI and experience.
