                        Planning an apps layout is essential in understanding how the app will look , feel and how the user will cruise around the app.

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>


                <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting an application with wireframes might look time consuming but actually knowing from the beginning where you are heading will save a lot of time. Wireframes can be done with pen and paper or using wireframe softwares (sketch ui , adobe experience XD).
                </p>
                <p>
                    ThA wireframe is the blueprint of websites / applications and mobile apps. The main purpose is to understand what you are building and show the client how the app will be structure before designing.
                </p>
                <p>Not using wireframes and jumping directly to developing an app might cause distress. Clients may like it but they might want to move a menu from the left on the right and then he wants the menu larger , smaller and so on creating inconsistency and wasting precious time rather than planning ahead.</p>


                <h3>Elements of a wireframe</h3>
                <p>
                    Wireframes should contain depending on the needs of the app a header , footer , sidebar and content areas and elements such as buttons , widgets etc.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    Structure
                    <li>Content - what will be displayed in the page</li>
                    <li>Structure - how are the elements connected</li>
                    <li>Hierarchy - how elements will be positioned , labeled and sized</li>
                    <li>Functionality - how will they work together</li>
                    <li>Behaviour - how does the elements interact </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Prototyping is meant to bring motion to wireframes for a further understanding of the navigation.</p>
