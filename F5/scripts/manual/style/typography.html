                <h3>Fonts</h3>

                <p>

                    Here are fonts that offer high readability and are clean sans serif styled perfect for most of F5 IT`s app as we develop business apps.
                    Other fonts relevant to other app purpose ( games etc.)
                </p><p>
                    Our main font used is Montserrat but others can be adopted , if we design for a client or it doesn`t meet the requirements. Such clean fonts are :  Lato , Roboto , Open Sans , Raleway
                </p>


                <h3>Type</h3>

                <p>
                    To obtain a visual hierarchy inside the app we need to devine various font sizes and a font family for the entire app.
                    Although 1 font family should be sufficient for an app a maximum of two fonts can be used on the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First step is to select the font family and then the needed headings. In theory "em" unit is the new standard for font sizes but in practice
                    percentage has proven to be more efficient for scaling.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Default font size - 1 em </li>
                    <li>Larger sizes for headings - 2.4 em </li>
                    <li>Medium sizes for sub-headings - 1.6 em </li>

                </ul>
